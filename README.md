Are you the type of reader who drops everything to read the new Homestuck: Beyond Canon update? I made this tool for you!
Every 10 minutes it checks for new pages, so you don't need to keep checking back manually. When an update comes out it tells you through a system notification.


Just download and run the installer and it will do all the work for you. How handy!
Alternatively, you can install the dependencies and run the Python script yourself, if you're into that type of thing.
